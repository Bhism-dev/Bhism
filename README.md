# Frontend

To work with the frontend, follow these commands:

1. Change directory to the frontend folder:
    ```
    cd frontend
    ```

2. Install the necessary dependencies:
    ```
    npm i
    ```

3. Start the development server:
    ```
    ionic serve
    ```

That's it! You are now ready to work on the frontend of your project.

```
NOTE: Step 2 is only required for the first time you set up the project. You can skip it for subsequent runs.
